# Leningen Installation Instructions

## Purpose ##

Hello! 

I created this resource for those, like me, who may need a little more details on how to properly install Leiningen, especially on Windows Systems.

Included (or will be included) in this resource are instructions on installing Leiningen on Windows (various versions), Linux, MacOS, provided I can access detailed instructions. 

I will also add (or try to add) common installation issues and their solutions (if applicable)

## A few notes ##

I am a Windows user so my experience with MacOS and Linux installation is limited. However, from my research, Windows users experience more concerns when installing than the other two. So, there may not be a lot for Mac and Linux.

## Contribution ##

If you see where this can be improved or have some unanswered questions, please add an issue :).

# Thank you very much and good day coding! #

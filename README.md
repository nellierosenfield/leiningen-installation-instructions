# Leningen Installation Instructions

## Purpose ##

Hello! 

I created this resource for those, like me, who may need a little more details on how to properly install Leiningen, especially on Windows Systems.

Included (or will be included) in this resource are instructions on installing Leiningen on Windows (various versions), Linux, MacOS, provided I can access detailed instructions. 

I will also add (or try to add) common installation issues and their solutions (if applicable)

# Mac Installation #

Howdy Windows users!

Below are step-by-step instructions on installing Leiningen. These were taken somewhat from the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/#install). I added some more details as well as an external resource for added clarification.

## Installation Steps ##

There are three-ish ways to install Leiningen on a Windows system and I will go through all of them.

#### Lein Installer (Easiest Way) ####

The easy way to install Leiningen is by running the unofficial Leiningen installer found here: [Leiningen Win Installer](https://djpowell.github.io/leiningen-win-installer/) by DJ Powell.

> Please note that downloading and using this installer is at **your** own risk. Obviously, scan for viruses and other malicious things before downloading something. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this installer (I used it myself and it worked beautifully) but never hurts to do a quick scan.

Also, look towards the bottom of the installer page to understand what will be added to your computer, such as environment variables and files.
